**A:** Yes at Dustin I have been working on a middleware based on Azure Container Apps which sits between ERP and CRM. It uses Azure Cosmos DB for data and exposes/consumes multiple APIs, service bus queues/topics etc..


**Q: What was challenging or interesting in this assignment.**

**Q: What you would improve or extend if you had more time.**

**A:** Add SQL db or similar + Improve openapi spec + example response
